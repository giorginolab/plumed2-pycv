PYCV: a PLUMED 2 Module Enabling the Rapid Prototyping of Collective Variables in Python
==========

T. Giorgino

This repository contains the **PYCV** module of PLUMED. It is a fork
of the official PLUMED2 repository taken at release v2.5.2. The
contributed code is entirely contained in the directories `src/pycv`
and `regtest/pycv`. Minor modifications were made to `configure` to
simplify installation.

The module's documentation is in the [README.md](src/pycv/README.md) file
contained in the module's directory.
